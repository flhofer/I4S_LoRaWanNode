# I4S_LoRaWanNode

The I4S* project invedtigates behavioral models of large scale LoRaWan networks used in smart contexts. This repository contains the microcontroller code for a _Harward architecture_ microcontroller for end-node testing. The AVR microcontroller performs regular transmissions in different configurations to test the performance of the network and the communication reliability. Transmission time samples will describe tbe behavior of the system and allow the creation of a model.

This is just one component of the I4S family. To exlore all components, browse through the repositories starting with 'I4S_'.

## Project setup

The project is build on the Arduino core to ease development and speed-up results. It has been integrated in *Eclipse CDT* with the *Sloeber* pluging to allow standard C/C++ development without loosing the advantage of premade _Serial_ and _I/O_ classes.
